# Spring Authentication

we use Authentication to help us protect our web page from unwanted users , so u can hide your password from others.

-using spring security ,the data that we initlizte in class as @Entity to be in database ,when the user enter the data from html ,we take it through

controllers and organized from class ,and stored into database ,now for important data like password ,we before store it in database ,we convert it 

to hash , so if someone reach database will not know what is the password , and also will not able to convert it to the orginal password.


-using spring security , there is method help u specifiy who can only  reach to your page , i think its called web security .
