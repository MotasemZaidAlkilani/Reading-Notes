# Array ,Loops ,Imports
Package is containing all your classes in the program toagter , it's define when u define your java program at first Time
,name of package will be as name of directory folder,and u can change it later as u want.package define first at the top. 
it's optional to write it.

Imports allow class to be used in others classes, u can used by write import then place of the class,
i will write the famous classes the u can import it and what used for:

swing,awt  :GUI Element
Java.util  :data Structure
java.io    :input/output
util.regex :regular expression

u can import all the classes from specifi package by writing after the package * symbol ,will show all classes inside 
the package,and that will not affect effiency of the program,it's only show the program all the classes it want and
remove the others.
note :u can use the other class without imports, by example :javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi");

Loops is block that execute all the set of instrtions inside it until the condtion become true,there 4 type of loops
in java:

for :( for(: : ) )is separate to 3 sections ,first section for initliaze where to begin,second section is condtion 
to stop for from continue,last one have code that will execute each cycle in for.

Enhanced for  :( for(  :  )  )have 2 section,first one for declare the current value that will use inside the for,
the second for specify which array u will use in this loop.

while : (   while()  ) execute instruction inside the while to infinite until the condtion that inside the braces
became false;

do-while : ( do{  } while();  ) it's oppsite to while ,it's execute first then check the condition .
