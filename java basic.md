# Java Basics
Java came in 1995 , and comes with library includes 250 programs ,that made coding 
easier for the developer ,library's programs has variety of amazing thing at that time ,it has a program that  can deal with disk files ,code for creating 
windows, code for passing information over the internet . over  the years,the programs  increased to about 4 thousend programs, and that library called application programming interface(api).

when we use java ,we use api most of the time ,even when we run java file ,it's run
using api for java ,and there also another 2 way to run java program ,java compilter and java virtual machine(jvm),and u when know them all , u can run your program by your favourite way.

now I want to talk about the essiential rules to help to begin with java ,and help u
to make your own program in future . now everything in the java is an object , what is object ? object is like anything in the real world , that has states and behvaior 
that make it unique to another objects ,like example a car , car has it own color and speed , and the behavior is car can move to forward or behind , turn on or off car is also a behivor , so the states describe the object ,and the behavoir is notice changing in the object.

Variable, variable?,what u mean by variable ? variable as it's mean , it changing over time ,and the variable in programming lanaguage is thing that u can store in it for later use,as your memory when u study,save subject'exam for use it at the exam,
ok...,what the componets of  variable? variable has first the type of variable ,like what the type of data u want to store ,is it numbers,words,letter? each type has it own specific name ,if want numbers there alot of types that u will pick , but mostly it's int , and for word String ,and for letter Char,and so on ,if u want to know the rest ,look at the internet.after picking the type,u must choose a name ,that help u and others to know what that variable for. the last thing value .

variables in java ,has 4 types depend on the place u declare the variables,u may not heard about the class in java ,but in the future u will .now if u declare inside class that will call a class variables ,the class variable relate to class 
and it's only one ,not many as for each object declared ,and it's a static because a unique value only for the class.the second type is instance variables ,and it's the same as objects variable that declared in class . and there local variable ,local variable is like local only for a method , so when u declare it inside method u can't reach it from outside the method .and the last thing is parameters,the parameters it's the gate to go inside the method from outside ,and be able to used inside the method.

naming variable in java has a rules ,but before it told u the rule ,java is a case sensitive ,ok...,what that mean? that mean capital and lower letter are differnet ,not the same ,so u can name a variable "a" and another variable "A" ,each varible is unique. now about the rules ,u can name using digits,letters,underscore,dollar sign,but numbers u cant put them at first index of the name, that will give u an error.

operators,hmm..... opertors i dont know how to describe it like on one word,but it's used in variety way i can say maybe ,opertors it's the same as mathmathical opertors ,use them in math way  to sum numbers or even words ,and another way,for help the user to get options when to go to other path in program ,that will lead to the end to the place he/she want.

 expressions is contex to change the values in variables ,or get result from it.
 Statement is line of code .
 and blocks is considered between braces.

the last thing ,i want to talk about is control flow statements ,this one is very important in coding ,this one help u and the users to get choices in your program,if program give alot of food and want to choose your favourite one ,here comes the control flow to guide the program to your choice.
