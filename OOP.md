# Object Oriented Programming

## Object
Objects are states and behavior as in real life , those two are main characteristics that share real life objects.
java using object orienited programming ,and that help to simulate the real objects and even abstart ideas in 
programming .i have example for object in real life , state for dog is age,color,breed ,so those states for example
when u see them in your dog ,u know that this dog is your dog because of the states ,in the other hand, the behavior 
can bark,sleep,Eat those behavior are the actions that this object can do, so states describe the object, and behavior
is the action that this object able to do.

## Class
class is set of properties that are common for objects, like u can say all dogs are comming from the same
class ,because all dogs are common in the base of properties ,like each dog have color propertie,yeah
each one have different color ,value of properties will not make difference to decide if that object
have to be in the class,the important thing that each class will have properties ,and like example
class will do as factory ,will produce sets of objects that will have the same properties as the class.

so u can declare new class by typing in top of file :

>class <nameOfClass>{
  
  >//body Of the class
  
 > }
  
  class have set of attributes or variable , dog color u declare it inside the 
  body of the class using int ,float, String,etc...
  
  class also have methods ,that u can declare the actions of your dog ,
  u can declare the blark action like that :
  
 >class <nameOfClass>{
  
  >public void blark(String soundOfblark){
  
 > //here type the action of blark }
  
  >}
  
  there thing called access modifier ,that determine if your class can be access from outside or not.
  there 2 types of access modifier :
  
  1-public :make class able to access from all classes
  2-private :make class able to access only within it's own class
  
  consturtor is method that initlize each new objects states ,when u enter the required information 
  to your object ,constructor will encapsulte the data inside new object.
