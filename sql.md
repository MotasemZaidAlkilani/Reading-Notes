# Summarize 

for the first exercises, I know them before, like taking data using select to get all data in table and using where to get specific data.
insert and update and delete were easy too, delete and update depend mostly on id to choose which to update or delete it. I have learned
how to order the data using order by, limiting the data using limit, using join to connect to another table and get data from there, and
finally the drop and alter, drop for delete the whole table, and alter to delete or add the column to the table.
