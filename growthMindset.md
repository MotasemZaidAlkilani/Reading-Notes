# Technical Skills
this article talks about how to improve yourself in the right way, not as like solve the same problem 
every day and expect yourself to be a better person.

the main idea for this article, it's to let yourself out of your comfort zone, it's hard and frustrating,
especially in the beginning, so like do a new thing and put yourself deep in it, and repeat it until
u became good enough, with feedback u will know how much good u are. oh, I forget, before u do all 
that u have to have a goal, like a good goal, that will keep u going forward.

# Growth mindest Video
video talking about a new idea that can make a huge effect on students, that will also reduce learning costs in motivating the students to study.
the idea when u heard it the first time, u would say is it  really valid, is it even help a little,
but when I heard  there a school applied this idea and after 1 year, like they became another level, but also
beat other students that study in a facility much much better, that really amazing, we have to try
it, especially in our country, we just care for higher marks.

what I wrote before was my opinion about the video, but now I will talk about the idea.
the idea is stoping giving students a reward when they do their homework and tell them that the reward is not yet, 
 don't give them never reward for their study, in the future, they will care only about rewards,  they will come 
 to school just to get higher marks and the study will be a tool, not a goal.
 
 # Grit 
 video talking about the thing that most companies or even individuals looking for, it's to know how to be able to do anything
 and keep doing it until the end. we know there a people who have passion about something in their lives, and they do anything to achieve it,
 they mostly reach the top, even if they, in the beginning, have resources less than the rest, so the presenter tried to 
 know how to make any person passionate in anything, she didn't find it, but she finds a way that maybe help the person
 to reach to their passion, and it's the grown mindset, the grown mindset means that person doesn't believe in failure,
 in his dictionary, and there is no word "failure",so when they fall, they keep trying until the end, and became the same as
 the passionate person.
 
 # Sucess
 The presenter talking about success in his own view, he thinks that like the most thing affect success, it's caring about people and materialistic,
 when u care about people's opinions about u,u became away from your true self, and do things that u don't want, just for making people accept u.
 society the way they treat each other, it's the reason for failure or more failure, and make u without any hope, just they care if u have 
 good job or have a lot of money and they don't care about the poor people and help them  raise themself up, all of that must change 
 for all of us to be happy and successful.
